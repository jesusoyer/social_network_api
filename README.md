# social_network_api
A social network api

## Description
This project is a fully functional social network API, that uses the express and mongoose technologies. This project was inspired by my curiosity on how to create the next big social media platform. I wanted to know what it would take to create a database that would function like a social media platform.
This project uses Express as its HTTP server to handle CRUD operations and used the Mongoose Object Document Mapper (ORM) to communicate with a MongoDB database. In this project I learned how to create an API that uses mongoose models and how to relate the schemas to each other.
